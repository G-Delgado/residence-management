### Warnings
- Remember that making Unit tests also create the .rem and .csv files with data later used on the program. Therefore, make sure to back it up first.
- The administrator is at first (and for the first and actual version of the program) created with the username: "root" and the password: "1234"
- Dont use the Login apartment button as it is used for experimental purposes. Instead, login with the apartment option with the number of the apartment, followed by a line and the number of the tower, eg.,  "201_1" and the password "1234"
- The program is initialized with 4 towers.
